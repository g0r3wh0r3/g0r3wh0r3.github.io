this page is still a work in progress! i will have more descriptions of the project soon, but feel free to scroll through the photos :) 

[the project](https://github.com/g0r3wh0r3/hydrogen-project)

I developed a prototype for a multimodal sensing system to monitor hydrogen concentration in natural gas pipelines. The system integrates ultrasonic and thermal conductivity sensors to determine hydrogen concentration. A machine learning model had been developed (not by me) to improve the accuracy of the results. This was run on a raspberry pi. I designed a PCB using KiCad, to power the sensors, acquire data from the sensors, and communicate with the raspberry pi. 

The PCB design went through several iterations.
