this project is still a work in progress! please see [the project github page](https://github.com/g0r3wh0r3/breath-music-interface) while i work on organising things. 

I'm exploring different interfaces for human interaction with devices by working on a breath-controlled audio effects pedal. I'm interested in learning more about audio electronics and analog circuits. I'm also working on developing my ability to lead projects and collaborate with others. 

The idea is that you would wear an elastic band around yous abdomen, which has a coil around it. As you breathe and the band stretches, the inductance of the coil changes.

I started learning about building pedals by participating in a workshop at the Schulich School of Engineering, where I assembled this pedal and got to learn how it works! (will upload image soon!)
